SRC-GIT repository for the FIPS gnutls.

The code is maintained in separate branches:

3.6.16-FIPS: Production FIPS gnutls for Rocky 8.
	Based on GNUTLS-3.6.16.

3.7.6-FIPS: Production FIPS gnutls for Rocky 9.
	Based on GNUTLS-3.7.6.

3.6.16-FIPS-FT: Functional test FIPS gnutls for Rocky 8.

	This code is only intended for funcitonal testing
	of the fips functionality and not to be used in production.
	This branch is a set of commits based ontop of FIPS-3.6.16 and is
	not supposed to be updated manually. Instead it should be rebased
	ontop of 3.6.16-FIPS anytime 3.6.16-FIPS changes.

3.7.6-FIPS-FT: Functional test FIPS gnutls for Rocky 9.

	This code is only intended for funcitonal testing
	of the fips functionality and not to be used in production.
	This branch is a set of commits based ontop of FIPS-3.7.6 and is
	not supposed to be updated manually. Instead it should be rebased
	ontop of 3.7.6-FIPS anytime 3.7.6-FIPS changes.

To run the functional test scripts from the 3.6.16-FIPS-FT or
3.7.6-FIPS-FT branches.

1). Build gnutls locally:
$ ./gnutls_config.sh `pwd`/INSTALLED
$ make -j
$ make install

Copy the created .hmac file into the installed library directory:

$ cp ./lib/.libs/.libgnutls.so.30.hmac INSTALLED/usr/lib64/

Run the functional tests:

$ ./post-test.sh INSTALLED/bin/gnutls-cli INSTALLED/bin/certtool

The functional test fail script post-test-inject-fail.sh must
be run as root and WILL MODIFY SYSTEM LIBRATIES. For that reason
it is recommended to run this inside a Rocky8 (for 3.6.16-FIPS-FT)
or Rocky9 (for 3.7.6-FIPS-FT) VM system.
