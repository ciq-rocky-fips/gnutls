SRC-GIT repository for the FIPS gnutls.

The code is maintained in separate branches:

FIPS-3.6.16: Production FIPS gnutls for Rocky 8.
	Based on GNUTLS-3.6.16.

FIPS-FT-3.6.16: Functional test FIPS gnutls for Rocky 8.

	This code is only intended for funcitonal testing
	of the fips functionality and not to be used in production.
	This branch is a set of commits based ontop of FIPS-3.6.16 and is
	not supposed to be updated manually. Instead it should be rebased
	ontop of FIPS-3.6.16 anytime FIPS-3.6.16 changes.

To run the functional test scripts from the FIPS-FT-3.6.16 branch.

1). Build gnutls locally:
$ ./gnutls_config.sh `pwd`/INSTALLED
$ make -j
$ make install

Copy the created .hmac file into the installed library directory:

$ cp ./lib/.libs/.libgnutls.so.30.hmac /usr/lib64/

Run the functional tests:

$ ./post-test.sh INSTALLED/bin/gnutls-cli INSTALLED/bin/certtool

The functional test fail script post-test-inject-fail.sh must
be run as root and WILL MODIFY SYSTEM LIBRATIES. For that reason
it is recommended to run this inside a Rocky8 VM system.
