SRC-GIT repository for the FIPS gnutls.

The code is maintained in separate branches:

FIPS-3.6.16: Production FIPS gnutls for Rocky 8.
	Based on GNUTLS-3.6.16.

FIPS-FT-3.6.16: Functional test FIPS gnutls for Rocky 8.

	This code is only intended for funcitonal testing
	of the fips functionality and not to be used in production.
	This branch is a set of commits based ontop of FIPS-3.6.16 and is
	not supposed to be updated manually. Instead it should be rebased
	ontop of FIPS-3.6.16 anytime FIPS-3.6.16 changes.
