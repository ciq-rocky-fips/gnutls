@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs} (gnutls_sign_algorithm_t @var{sign}, unsigned int @var{secure})
@var{sign}: the sign algorithm

@var{secure}: whether to mark the sign algorithm secure for certificates

Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  @code{sign} as secure
or insecure for the use in certificates. This only has effect when
the algorithm is marked as secure through the allowlisting mode in
the configuration file, or when the setting is modified with a
prior call to this function.

When  @code{secure} is true,  @code{sign} is marked as secure for any use unlike
@code{gnutls_sign_set_secure()} .  Otherwise, it is marked as insecure only
for the use in certificates.  Use @code{gnutls_sign_set_secure()}  to mark
it insecure for any uses.

This function must be called prior to any session priority setting functions;
otherwise the behavior is undefined.
