@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_sign_set_secure} (gnutls_sign_algorithm_t @var{sign}, unsigned int @var{secure})
@var{sign}: the sign algorithm

@var{secure}: whether to mark the sign algorithm secure

Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  @code{sign} as secure
or insecure.  This only has effect when the algorithm is marked as
secure through the allowlisting mode in the configuration file, or
when the setting is modified with a prior call to this function.

Even when  @code{secure} is true,  @code{sign} is not marked as secure for the
use in certificates.  Use @code{gnutls_sign_set_secure_for_certs()}  to
mark it secure as well for certificates.

This function must be called prior to any session priority setting functions;
otherwise the behavior is undefined.
