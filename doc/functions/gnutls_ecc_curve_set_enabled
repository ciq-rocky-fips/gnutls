@deftypefun {int} {gnutls_ecc_curve_set_enabled} (gnutls_ecc_curve_t @var{curve}, unsigned int @var{enabled})
@var{curve}: is an ECC curve

@var{enabled}: whether to enable the curve

Modify the previous system wide setting that marked  @code{curve} as
enabled or disabled.  This only has effect when the curve is
enabled through the allowlisting mode in the configuration file, or
when the setting is modified with a prior call to this function.

This function must be called prior to any session priority setting functions;
otherwise the behavior is undefined.

@strong{Returns:} 0 on success or negative error code otherwise.

@strong{Since:} 3.7.3
